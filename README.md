# Day-Planner
## A simple planner to track the days events
I created a basic daily calendar that allows a user to enter their activities for the day, and save it to local storage so that they have a way to maintain that info until it is no longer needed.

The technologies that I used were:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Moment.js
- Bootstrap JS & CSS
- Font Awesome

Below you will find a screenshot of the deployed site, that can be found at https://melissa-stott.github.io/Day-Planner/
